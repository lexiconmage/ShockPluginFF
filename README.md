A simple Dalamud plugin used to link your PiShock shocker in FFXIV

## Repository

Add this as a custom repository:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lexiconmage/ShockPluginFF/master/repo.json
```

## Setting it up

* Enter the three pieces of information necessary to connect to the PiShock servers on the 'Settings' tab (Api Key, Username, Shocker Code)
You can also select which channels that the plugin will listen on in the same tab. 

* Triggers can be added in the triggers tab. To add a trigger, click the + button, then fill out the Regex (which requires a regular expression), Duration, and Intensity fields, and ensure that it is enabled. 

* The 'Death Mode' button can be enabled for a dynamic experience while gaming. It will deliver scaled shocks to you every time a party member dies, scaling with the number of currently-dead members until a maximum duration of 15 seconds and intensity of 100.

Credit to Cordelia for her endlessly useful plugin Gagspeak, both as a reference for much of the rewritten UI and for the tool, and to Belda for making the initial version.
